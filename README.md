# CoffeeHouse
CoffeeHouse is a medium for musicians to collaborate, experiment and create open-source music.

## How it Works

By creating a lightweight, git-style version control system, we allow musicans to create a new song (repository) with a base audio track.
They can then advertise their song to other musicians, for them to clone, add, remove, and modify individual layers within the song.

From there, the original creator can see all the different contributions and modifications made to their base track.
